A tribute (and reinterpretation) to the all-powerful Board Game Geek, THE reference web for us board game fans.<br />

### Coded with 📋

* [Angular 9](https://angular.io/)
* [Mongoose.js](https://mongoosejs.com/)

### Getting started 🔧

_You want to try this project in your computer?_<br />

First, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your computer.
Second, you need to have [Angular cli](https://angular.io/cli) installed too:<br /> ```npm install -g @angular/cli```

Run ```npm install``` in the root folder and concurrently will install all the node_modules in both folders.<br />
Remember to rename "backend/config/config.example.json" to "backend/config/config.json" and configure your own variables.<br />
<br />
Then run ```npm start``` (in the root folder too) and wait for angular to compile... 😴
Your browser will open a tab in [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).<br />

### Seeding 🌱

Before you hit ```npm start```, you can (have to) create your database and tables... And maybe populate them if you want.

```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
cd ..
```
NOW you can hit that ```npm start```!
